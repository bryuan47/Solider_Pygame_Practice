Absolutely! If you like the **parabolic jump algorithm**, there are several other **simple motion or game algorithms** that follow the same “step-by-step math to simulate movement or behavior” idea. Here’s a list for you:

---

### 1️⃣ **Parabolic jump / projectile motion**

* What we just talked about
* Smooth up-and-down jump
* Can also be used for throwing objects in an arc

---

### 2️⃣ **Linear movement / constant velocity**

* Move a character or object at a constant speed
* Example: `x = x + speed` every frame
* No acceleration, no curves — straight line motion

---

### 3️⃣ **Gravity simulation**

* Adds a velocity variable that changes over time
* Realistic free-fall motion

```python
velocity_y += gravity
y += velocity_y
```

* Can combine with jump for more realistic physics

---

### 4️⃣ **Oscillating motion / sine wave**

* Objects move up and down smoothly like a wave
* Example for floating objects, enemies, or bullets

```python
y = base_y + amplitude * math.sin(time)
```

---

### 5️⃣ **Acceleration / deceleration (ease-in, ease-out)**

* Speed changes over time, making movement feel smooth
* Often used in animations
* Example:

```python
speed += acceleration
position += speed
```

---

### 6️⃣ **Friction / sliding (drift)**

* Objects slowly stop moving when you stop pressing keys

```python
velocity *= 0.9  # reduce velocity gradually
position += velocity
```

---

### 7️⃣ **Path following / lerp (linear interpolation)**

* Move an object smoothly from point A → B

```python
x = x + (target_x - x) * 0.1
y = y + (target_y - y) * 0.1
```

---

### 8️⃣ **Bounce off walls / reflection**

* Reverse direction when hitting a boundary

```python
if x <= 0 or x >= width:
    velocity_x *= -1
```

---

### 9️⃣ **Chasing / AI following**

* Enemy moves toward the player

```python
dx = player_x - enemy_x
dy = player_y - enemy_y
enemy_x += dx * 0.05
enemy_y += dy * 0.05
```

---

### 10️⃣ **Random movement / wandering**

* Object moves unpredictably for enemies or particles

```python
x += random.choice([-1, 0, 1])
y += random.choice([-1, 0, 1])
```

---

💡 **Pattern you’ll notice:**
Most of these are **discrete simulation algorithms** — they:

* Use a variable for position (`x` or `y`)
* Update it every frame
* Optionally include **speed, acceleration, or direction**

---

If you want, I can **make a “cheat sheet table” showing all of these with formulas and visual explanations** so you can see the patterns at a glance.

Do you want me to do that?
